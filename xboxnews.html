            <h3>XBOX NEWS</h3>

            <p>Microsoft has announced a two-day slate of livestreams, billed as a replacement to its talks and panels at the now-postponed Game Developers Conference. One of those talks is titled 'Xbox Series X + Project xCloud = New Chapter in Gaming', leading to speculation that we could learn new details about the next-gen console.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Titled Game Stack Live, the series of livestreams will air on Mixer across March 17-18, and will allow viewers to "learn about the latest cloud and game development technologies from Microsoft, go behind the scenes with the creators at Xbox Game Studios and the ID@Xbox program, and level up with deep technical talks and panel discussions led by industry leaders."</p>

            <br>

            <p>'Xbox Series X + Project xCloud = New Chapter in Gaming' will air on Wednesday, March 18 at 11.40am Pacific / 2.40pm Eastern / 6.40pm UK (that's March 19 at 5.40am AET). Microsoft hasn't specifically said the talk will include new information, but the interaction between Series X and xCloud (Microsoft's game streaming service) is still relatively unexplored.'</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>There's a lot more besides the Series X talk, too â€“ talks will come from members of the teams behind Gears 5, Sea of Thieves, Wasteland, and more, and the final talk includes discussion of technical details we know are confirmed as Xbox Series X features.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>GDC talks are traditionally more developer focused, so all of them are likely to fall on the more technical side. You can see the full schedule (all timings in PT) below:</p>
